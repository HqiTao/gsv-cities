Official repo for Neurocomputing 2022 paper: **GSV-Cities: Toward Appropriate Supervised Visual Place Recognition**

---

**Summary:**

We collect a large-scale dataset for visual place recognition, with highly accurate ground truth. We call it **GSV-Cities** (GSV refers to Google Street View). We also propose, in the same paper, a fully convolutional aggregation technique (called **Conv-AP**) that outperforms NetVLAD and most existing SotA techniques.
